## We're Building!

The foundational work for Dome42 has officially commenced. Our mission is to build a unified SaaS platform that makes cybersecurity and regulatory compliance simple, automated, and accessible for Europe's Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

In today's digital landscape, the regulatory and threat environment is more complex than ever. New directives like **NIS2, DORA, and the Cyber Resilience Act** are placing significant demands on businesses, while cyber threats continue to grow in sophistication. For many SMEs, navigating this reality is a major challenge.

Dome42 is our answer. We are developing an **AI-Powered CISO** to act as a co-pilot for your business, automating the heavy lifting of compliance and providing continuous, 24/7 security monitoring. We want to democratize access to top-tier cybersecurity, making it a standard for everyone, not a luxury for the few.

This section will serve as our roadmap. Here, we will share our progress, discuss the challenges we face, and offer insights into the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity and compliance.

Stay tuned for more updates as we bring Dome42 to life.
